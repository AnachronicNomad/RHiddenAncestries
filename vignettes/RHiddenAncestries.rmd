# Usage
```r
HA(reference, observed)
```

# Arguments

**D**
    Dataframe with N SNPs. Variables include Chromosome, RSID, A1, A2, k reference ancestry allele frequencies, obs number of heterogeneous observed allele frequencies.
    
**k**
    Integer number of reference ancestries present in the model
    
**obs**
    number of observed ancestries in the merged data. obs specifies which observed ancestry will be run through the algorithm.
